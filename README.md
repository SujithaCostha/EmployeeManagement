Welcome to my GitHub repository for a small Employee Management System built with SQL Server, ASP.NET, and C#!

## Employee Management System

This project is a simple yet powerful Employee Management System designed to streamline the process of managing employees' information within an organization. It provides a user-friendly web-based interface that allows HR personnel or authorized employees to efficiently handle various tasks related to employees.

### Key Features:

1. **Employee Database:** The system is built upon SQL Server, providing a robust and secure database to store and manage employee records. It includes essential information such as personal details, contact information, job title, department, and more.

2. **User Authentication and Access Control:** Security is a top priority. The system implements user authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manipulate employee data.

4. **Employee Search and Filtering:** The system allows users to search and filter employees based on various criteria, making it easier to find specific individuals or groups.

5. **Add, Edit, and Delete Employees:** Authorized users can add new employees to the system, update existing information, or remove outdated records.

6. **Leave Management:** A built-in leave management feature enables employees to request leaves, and supervisors can approve or reject those requests. It helps to maintain attendance records and ensures proper coverage.


### Technology Stack:

- **ASP.NET:** The project is built on the ASP.NET framework, ensuring scalability and easy integration with web services.

- **C#:** The business logic is implemented in C#, providing a structured and maintainable codebase.
